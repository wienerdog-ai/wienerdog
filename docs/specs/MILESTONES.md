# Milestones — release gates

These are the project's historical build phases (M0–M7) and their binding
release-gate acceptance criteria. The phase sequence has been consumed up to
M7; work packages no longer carry a milestone field — the optional `epic:`
frontmatter field is the only grouping label on a spec (ADR-0029). Consult
this table when judging release readiness, not when drafting a WP.

| M | Name | Acceptance (summary) |
|---|---|---|
| M0 | Foundation | Docs, ADRs, spec system, agents, dogfood scaffold exist (this commit). |
| M1 | Skeleton & installer | Clean-machine `npx wienerdog` creates `~/.wienerdog` + vault (git-initialized), detects harnesses; `uninstall --dry-run` lists exactly what was created; `doctor` passes. |
| M2 | Claude adapter + interview | `/wienerdog-setup` produces `06-Identity/*`; CLAUDE.md managed block rendered; new session demonstrably knows the user via injected digest; `sync` idempotent. *Go-public possible.* |
| M3 | Capture + dreaming | Fixture transcripts incl. planted injection → gated notes with provenance; injection never reaches Tier 3; one git commit per run; readable dream report; `git revert` cleanly undoes a run. |
| M4 | Codex adapter | Codex-only machine (no hooks) gets full setup + working dream from rollout files alone. |
| M5 | Google Workspace | Guided OAuth completes; gmail/cal/drive read+draft work headlessly from `claude -p`; sends execute only under a grant, ungranted sends degrade to draft+notice (ADR-0007); tokens 0600, survive reboot. |
| M6 | Scheduler + routine catalog | Native schedule entries on each OS; simulated hang → watchdog kill + alert; job missed by shutdown (dream included) runs within an hour of the machine being back; catalog flow (ADR-0008) configures digest incl. its send-to-self grant; digest arrives by email. |
| M7 | Hardening & release | Threat model finalized vs implementation; install→use→uninstall leaves only the vault; fresh-machine install from README alone; npm publish. |
